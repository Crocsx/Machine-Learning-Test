It's great and relaxing, it's fun
I used to love this game but it seems so broken now, on the trail i bought a box for 6 favours and i didnt get anything. Also, a red pine log was covering my view and i couldnt even grab it. Really needs improvements.
Great, but every time I played again i had to start from the beggining, thats the only issue, I even have some achievements, but beyond that, the game is really great.
really good games thank you so much for everything you done for me it's really nice and comfortable for me are you always do it what is it doing great thank you
I love this game. I've played it before and recently redownloaded it. I love all the new improvements. I would give it 5 stars but it needs a new update for the bugs and crashes... But if you have the patience to wait out the crashes. Then it's a very relaxing fun game!
When i launch the game all i got was a white screen. It was working fine today. I reinstall it and the issue still remains. By the time the white screen disappear a notifcation appear claiming that theres an error and the game began to work in the background. Which is weird.
My child loves its great for learning how to colour
This is a 1 star game at its best. Hey Kongregate, maybe try actually caring about your game! You say " uhh hey, just contact customer support." What customer support!!! It's not there, we send a message and hear absolutley NOTHING back. What a great way to run a business. I'm going to say this very loud and clear: YOU GUYS ARE PROBABLY THE WORST GAME DEVELOPERS OF ALL TIME, ACTUALLY TRY GIVING A S**T ABOUT SOMETHING! I don't understand why this is an editors choice, it absolutley sucks.
The graphic and the characters are great and enjoyable. The gameplay is good, but at some point the items are covered by the menu or buttons so it's kinda hard to click the items. The story is great, but the journey to the city and to build your home is kinda too long that it's bored me easily.
Super addictive. However, I just upgraded to Android Pie and with the full screen app feature, the game is sort of zoomed in and numbers seem cut off (ex. Home upgrade requirements used to show '10/25' for example, but now it just shows '10/2' bc there is no space)
Could've been a great game, but.. Glitches, bugs, no updates. Cleared cache, reinstalled. Still blank screen. Update: Devs included develop a community, find partner, raise a family, make a business, et cetera, but none of those are true. Been playing, yes, yet nothing new with the updates.
I love this game, but it is a bit buggy at times. Still, I get so addicted to this game and it keeps me playing for hours on end.
Amazing graphics and Amazing concept This game is just a fun relaxing thing to play I really love the whole "you can be whatever kind of person you want" vibe The only problem is the walking mechanic the whole swipe up and down thing because I have missed multiple items on my travel because of this So developpers if you could please add like buttons or just another way to slow down or something like "double tap to stop" it would make the game easier :P
I love this app because you can play it and have no wyfi I think it is great.
Great for call ages
I like this game because its relaxing
I love it it keeps me busy
Love it sooo Addictive and Cute
Very nice and enjoy it alot
Stupid app and it takes up all your space.
Addicting app i dont like the gems tho all of it should be free
I'm actually pretty angry! I spent well over $100 and I had to get a new phone. I have the game downloaded now, and apparently I "cant" get my old account back. Even though I connected to google account. So now its $100 down the drain. I have contacted support and it's been about a week, and not a single reply. DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME!
I really like the game it's really good I think that this game should be number one
Inside games, there must not be 'in app purchases' .Games must be 'in app downloads' .The 'in app purchasing' is very wrong.
It fun and colful
luv to be able to select my own colors..more free...
I love it so much that I have been playing it for hours and hours of the day.
very relaxing for me easy app love
this app is fun and easy to use
This game is addicting. As you move along the trail you collect supply to craft things to trade and sell to other players. It's a relaxing game to play at night. The music is soft and the scenery along the trail is beautiful done.
This game is one of the best mobile game I have ever played and you can play it on the go the only thing that I had a problem with is that you have to pay 5,000 dollars for a private chest and if you pay for a shelf people can steal stuff it also is quite annoying when you have one thing left to upgrade your house and you can't get your stuff back at least it takes a half a hour
I really like this app I just don't like that you can't use all the materials but other than that ❤️❤️
i love it and love drawling
It was very very slow
crashed after i spent ages on it and i cant get past the opening screen it just goes white :/
Yes i love painting and coloring
Tis a good app and it's relaxing.
The game crashed 3 times at the same point - when the girl said that the bird might be the reason Beatrice is so fast. I thought my new OnePlus 7 Pro was crashing... On top of that, the game hasn't been update since August 2018... disappointing.
I loved this app it so relaxing
Just all around trash. First off the game is clunky and actions half the time are unresponsive. Secondly people are asshats who take everything. You should not be able to have the items you chooped a tree down for be able to be taken. The whole replaying the trail only becomes newbies struggling to keep up with players whove run it for awhile. Just a waste of time i wish i could get back. Garbage.
Its relaxing and keeps my mind focused on the picture.
i really like that.
i just wish we could have all of the cokors unlocked...Other than that its a great app
I love it because of the lovely color
I really, really enjoyed playing this game, making chits, clothes, etc. The only thing I have to say about this though, is that it's kind of hard to make chits. I had to travel back to several campsites to make that money and be able to cross the river for 400 chits. Maybe consider an update that makes it easier to get chits?
I like it I just don't like that I need Diamonds to colour pictures
Like to color gorgeously!!
It so much fun when your bored!!
This happens everytime! The game freezes at a particular point and my character wouldn't move even if the internet is of high speed! the point where I have to cut the logs, my character is just freezing. I loved this game, but now I have to uninstall it!
good app kills time has good pictures
Crash and freeze just when i arrived in my first town...shame on you dev
Very Relaxing game
It's very calming and fin to do when stressed
Fun game but has a few random glitches that are really fustrating. When I craft items they freeze in the middle of the screen and wont move until I restart the game, but then I usually lose the item. And when you are on the trails it wont allow you to collect all the items you need for the bird tasks. Ill walk past an item and it wont allow me to collect it. Also you spend more time crafting clothes than anything else. They seem to make it thru 1 or 2 walks and then there done.
Played several weeks its buggy in general(on a Galaxy S9+) but was correcting itself. Changed towns & then I could no longer use warehouse/could not complete daily tasks-which kneecaps advancement. That plus the constant bugs and relentless ads/microtransactions makes this game trash. Dont waste the download the Devs dont care & there is no longer game support.
It's an interesting game that takes its time to hook you into thw basic gameplay loop of gathering, crafting, and selling...before utterly destroying all your hopes and dreams with crushing brutality and near constant reminders that your torment can be eased with payment.
Good Drawings Collection
this is a pretty nice app ecspesialy because I am an artsy crafty person!💖
it's a pretty good game. easy to play with cool graphics. long term game with plenty to do. just wish there was more interaction between players in town. please update soon and expand the trail and house upgrade.
Lines "Hey Traveller, Look at me I have a Red umbrella". The Animation Indicates that I have to swipe down. I have tried this many times and It does not work
Should've listened to y'all, played this game all day and finally got to town, spent $17.99 atleast and then it got very buggy and wouldn't open... I uninstalled it boys.. you are all correct, it sent me back to practically the beginning with none of my gear. Kinda salty since it happened 5 minutes ago.
good game if tou like drawing or coloring
this app makes u either pay to color or wait for ever to earn dimonds to color.
Good game over all. I closed it to take a break then went back to it but now it wont load. it just stays at the white screen. cleared cache and all that basic stuff. still isnt working.
Must have coloring app gor everyons!!!!!
The game would have been great if it didn't crash on the start up all the time. I really liked this game before and downloaded it again to play it but now I remember why i uninstalled it in the first place. Because it crashed all the time at the start up screen.
Truly an amazing game. I just get sucked into the world. The music and the sound effects are great and satisfying.
Figured out the controls upon re-installing and going through the tutorial a third time. Pretty good, but I kinda wish there were more options for conversing with others. overall a great game in my opinion.
Beautiful, super fun, just the right amount of challenging to laid-back, and you can spend hours on this app without even noticing! Just wish we could actually talk to other players instead of just a few predetermined phrases.
It's great to get rid of stress
I was expecting this to be really bad but its just the opposite! I love the trading mechanic, the art style and how you can pick things up far away. I've only been playing for 30 minutes but i can tell the developers put a ton of time into it!! I really suggest you get it
So far the game isn't going really great I like everything about except the fact that you can take things away from people when they fall when you fall people can take all of your stuff and then you have to get it back and then it's a endless cycle of rage I hope that the game could do something about it.
I really like this game and would love to give it 5 stars, but it hasn't been updated in over A YEAR. Who does that? There are parts left unfinished and claiming "coming soon". They will still take your money, but forgot about taking care of the game. I find that terrible.
👍Just save it before you loose it accidentally
It's so nice
I honestly love this game and want to give it 5 stars. I have just recentely re-downloaded this game on my new phone and I was happy when I found out that me progress was transferred from my old phone. The first time I opened the app it all worked gine but then when I later on tried to open it again all i got was a white screen. I hope this is just a glitch and the developers can fix it but untill they do I am going to unistall it. Please fix this problem, I honestly love this game.
lost all of my progress multiple times
I would give it 5 stars if I could log in to Facebook so that I won't lose my diamonds when I have to change phones
I love this game, but lately it's been glitching, and I have lost so much gold, chits, and items!! I make stuff, and it freezes then disappears! I wish this would get fixed!!
First, this game takes up 301 mb. Second, after you take up about TWENTY MINUTES OF YOUR TIME the game simply never never loads. It just shows a white screen! Please give me a reason to even give this game TWO stars!!! What a waste of life!
Very basic designs
I love this game. The survival aspect is very thoughtful and I enjoy how simple the game is while still keeping me entertained with its challenges. I am recently having a problem with the services in town where the warehouse crashes my game. Keep improving and I will definitely keep playing
It relaxes you .you get to pick what ever color beautiful amazing
So OSM💯♥️♥️ app beyond my expectations and it is the app which I'll remember always to use in further life🎮🎮🎨🎨
not a good selection o drawings
Looove it....its relaxing and productive at the same time
Fun, relaxing, cute, but basically unplayable due to poor optimization. The longer it runs, the worse it performs, until eventually every action is a frustrating slideshow. Please fix this so I can enjoy this game.
I wish you also had color by number pictures too.
It's awsome but it's kind of annoying
This is a really good 😍
Love this game. It's such a great way to waste time, but like Godus (22cans other game) you reach a certain level and it's like the developers cant be bothered with it any more. Game can be slightly laggy, but if you like endlessly collecting stuff, it's pretty good!
Literally uninstalled because my character would NOT stop running. I had to open my bag to get him to stop. I know how to make him slow down by sliding down or up on my character. This bug of it getting stuck ruined the game for me.
a really great timekiller, love it!
great game! the clothing doesnt last very long, and the trips across the rivers can be really expensive. otherwise, i love it!!!
Love to draw,thus love the app
Dark paper bug. Low resolution
So fun and you don't have to pay money
It was fun but it could be beder
This apps is very wonderful .. i love it ..
AmaZing those of u who love to get AmaZing wallpaper this is seriously a great idea plus the pics are just cramazing (crazy amazing)
I had a lot of good progress on this game and all of the sudden one day it had reset EVERYTHING . ALL OF MY PROGRESS. ALL OF IT. Needless to say I will never download it again. NEVVEEEEERR.
I love this app it the best coloring game
Cool game but what's the point of a game like this if you can't play with your friends . You can't even add friends or see your friends on the trail. You do see other people but the most the time from other countries with no one to speak to them. Like I said fun concept but needs a little revamping.
a lot of peaceful fun !!
I would rate this game five stars because i love it and its a good game but its 2020 and it has not been updated since 2018.
I love this game, however its hardly ever updated! The Lumberyard has had a coming soon sign on it forever and there are tasks that are impossible to complete without an update! Get it together Kongregate!
oblige colouring so this app is perfect for me
love the color but have to pay with diamond
love it, super relaxing! !!!
Entertaining when you are in bored creative mood
very fun game. relaxing and you dont have to wait for ever for things to be completed. I hope updates are coming in the near future. I'd love to see this game progress more.
This sucks you have to pay money for a coloring book i would rather get one from the store
i like how you can creat your own art 🎊☺😊🎉
It's really sad that they abandoned the game. It had so much potential and the idea was amazing. Wished they kept updating it
Would B nice 4 ads 2 B in between pictures
I love the app. Its so relaxing and fun.
You can literally only pain 10 pictures for free🙄
I like it but I wish you didn't have to buy everything with diamonds and I also don`t know how to get diamonds
The game is awesome but what I don't like is that whenever your walking the screen kind of freezes and it makes you not to grab things and it's frustrating because you have to close the game and open it back again and sometimes do it all over it again
Good game and simple. I really hope the developers continue working on it.
Nice and relaxing
it's not a bad app I just dont like how you have to buy so many things with diamonds
It seems this app has been abandoned and not updated since aug. 2018. I'll rate this 5 star if glitches will be resolve
It's very good and good colours
A great game
good game but the logs are nearly impossible to pick up, ill spend 4 minutes trying to pick it up only to continually select the tree stump itself to the point where i just keep walking and miss important items.
It calm me down after a big fight and its a good way to just chill
Stuck on 2nd step of tutorial. It says look around I have red umbrella and an arrow pointing downward . I followed the arrow but nothing happens. I restarted the game for 5 times already and still stuck on that step
I liked the game, was having fun playing it. Then the game asked me to craft an item with 1 stone and 2 wood. And gave me only one wood. Then it crashed and never worked again
great app ,once you start you dont want to stop
its a really go color game if you like stuff like it
It so relaxing and awesome!!🤩
I got into Eden Falls I bought a hat for my dog with 12 favours and went into negative 200,000 chits. I restarted the game and could not get it to fix. I uninstalled the game and then reinstalled it, It would not let me sign into Google play to retrieve my cloud save data. I don't understand what has happened and I am disappointed I lost my work after many hours I put into this game. If you are new to the game it is a amazing game and I would highly recommend it. Please contact me if how to fix
it was very confusing and slow but it was okay I rate it a 4
Hello please make some more updates at this game its cool I love the gameplay I love survival....but sometimes there are some glitches happening at my house sometimes my house is disappearing and some items are not claimable you can't get it.. and sometimes your items are saving to your backpack its a little bit laggy but its cool! Like it💗
I Love to color
nice game at first. impossible at times as everyone steals from you when you are fatigued and pass out. the step i got stuck on is when it costs crits of like 3k i mean wow. so its a spending money game after all. nah, thanks for a couple days fun i guess. too expencive.
u have to get gems just to color some images
I love it but there's a lot of adds
great........ whenever ,i get time, i indulge myself into this app.id love immerse myself in this colourful world.
I would rate this game 5 stars but it is constantly crashing as of late, and I have lost gold horseshoes and materials because of this. Other than that though, awesome game.
Easy game to use.
Lots of fun!
Cool App) How do you Earn more Gems?
Relaxing and Enjoying
It does not work well I think that they should upgrade it.
It has so many cool pics to color love it
love the color selection ability
I need the editors to read this. I really enjoyed your game EXCEPT for the fact that I just saved up enough to buy a dog and a ball I continued to do other things in the game and got daily goals done but the game froze and was being very slow so I closed the app and all of my other apps I reopened the trail and my dog was GONE my horseshoe things were GONE and all my daily goals were UNDONE! I want my money back I want my dog and I want the game to quit freezing and glitching.
It is amazing to relax with this app
Love everything about this game! The only reason I gave 4 stars is it does like to freeze up and force stop quite often. Fix that and it's perfect
I love this App. Thank you
Very good addictive game
It's a really enjoyable game...but when I chose to be a trader, it immediately froze and wouldn't let me walk. It just FORCED me to look at this other avatar. I had to delete it straight after, because it was doing something to my iPad TOO.
A really good app
it's very nice especially when you're bored
Like this game but it keeps glitching. I tried to make hats and they keep getting stuck so I cant actually use/get them
One of my fav coloring apps!
It's been incredibly addicting but I love working with the town! Super easy and super fun!
I do not like this game. In the middle of the game I was suddenly cut off from my Google account and could not login because the game system did not respond
This game is fun and I love playing it♡♡♡ Thanks°♡let's see if you 🦋 🐯🦁🦁🦌🐈🦌🦓🐯🦓🦌🦌🐯🦄🐈🐽🐯🦄🦌🦄🦌🦄🦌🦄🐅🐅🐈🐮🐈🐯🐈🐯🦄🐗🦌🦌🦌🦄🐯🦄🦌🐯🦄🐯🦄🐯🦄🐯🐯🦄🐯🦄🐯🦄🐯🦄🐯🐯🦄🐯🦄🐯🦄🐯🦌🦄🐯🦄🐯🦄🦌🦌🦄🐾🐻🐰🐻🐾🐼🐻🐰🐻🐰🐀🐰🐻🐰🐼🐻🐼🐻🐰🐻🐰🐻🐼🐼🐀🐼🐻🐰🐻🐰🐻🐼🐼🐻🐼🐻🐼🐻🐰🐻🐰🐰🐻🐰🐀🐰🐻🐼🐰🐻🐼🐻🐼🐻🐼🐻🐼🐰🐻🐰🐻🐰🐻🐰🐰🐻🐰🐻🐰🐻🐼🐰🐻🐾🐻🐾🐻🐼🐼🐀🐼🐻🐰🐻🐰🐻🐰🐀🐦🐦🐦🐦🐰🐻🐻🐇🐇🐀🐇🐀🦒🐹🦌🦌🦌🐮🐮🐮🍄🥔🥑🥔🥑🍒🥑🥑🍒🍓🍐🍐 Did you finish it???♡♡♡ hope you did
the game is great, really relaxing and the advertisement system is well made. it has no popups which the player doesn't want to se, he controls everything. The game has the frontiersmen atmosphere to it and I recommend it to everyone.
pictures should be free.
Hated it. It is a total copy of InColor except it has daimond instead of VIP
Nice game, wish it would freeze randomly and won't even boot at times please fix or patch it
I'm so happy with you should download it
I've played this game before, it's so fun, I got to Eden falls last time but couldn't go any further because I couldn't buy a house because I couldn't buy online, but now I can, and I will gladly play this game again just to continue passed Eden falls, well done! :)
As soon as you reached the fourth snow camp area the game crashes i bot a gamer phone same thing fix this now
I do not Ike it because every thing is not free and because when I take a picture and use a color it cover the hold thing
The art in this game is beautiful and the atmosphere just soothes you, but It's just never ends and it just goes on and on. It'd be better if there is a login option so that we wouldn't have to play it all over again if we change our phone whatsoever.
This is fine. BUT It's so unfair that other gamers can steal your loot when you are faint. This ruins all good impression.
Love it takes my stress away
very good and smoothing
Addicting game. Played it again after 2 yrs. Still got me. I enjoyed it more when I purchased clothes that doesn't run out. Unfortunately it's not fully compatible with Oppo A5 2020 phone because the side tabs no longer fit the screen when you're choosing a quest. Even settings tab doesn't fit the screen either
This is a great game and I do enjoy the game. Recently, I found a bug that new crafted items are not automatically dropped into backpack, it instead sticks on screen and become unusable. Hope it will get fixed very soon. Thank you for the hard work.
Fun & relaxing
it's fun and love how the colors are
its good but i like more when its free 😅
Controls are by far the worst part of the game!only got to pt3 of the tourtial where you have to look at the woman in the red hat and the game wont even let me move!how the hell do i play the game if it only lets look around?! All i get is a arrow telling me to swipe down but theres really nothing i can do. Pls help!
I love this game. By far its one of my favorites. I only dislike one thing. Each time i go in, after only two minutes it kicks me out. If that would be fixed it would definitely be five star
Love this game, it's easy and simple. It's really nice as a distraction when life isnt going too well. Great for anxiety too! Reccomemding to all friends and family!
Such a simple game and yet so addictive. Beautiful graphics seriously I just can't stop looking at the scenery. Unique concepts and simple control. Just keep up the good work! ^^
Enjoyable time waster. Calming
Nice and relaxing
Ok really bad lag with the storage space and it just won't start up after like 15 min is also has a lot of bugs
well its a good game once but now its a dead game now no more updates like events before and other really important things to be updated in the game, unfinished quest and too much coming soon, hope soon the developers of this game bring back the life in the game, so dissapointed if this amazing game thrown like a garbage
I'd give this game a higher rating if it didn't have so many glitches. Relaxing, unobtrusive ads that you can choose to watch or not, and no need to spend money unless you're hardcore.
I uninstalled this because i needed storage. And here i am back once again...
I don't like writing reviews but I liked this game 😋
Love the selection
lots of fun!!
It is very good for time and stress
It's an amazing game, would give 5 stars if it had a friend system and a chat system
very easy to use
I Flippin LOVE!!! This App. Like SOOOO MUCH!!!!!
Could be better. The game itself is nice and addictive, but there are so many glitches. Every time I open my safe a random pair of moccasins appear. Now I opened the game and I had no pants and my amulet was gone... it makes me stop playing
Its an overall great game but ive encountered so many glitches and Bugs in this game that it has gotten annoying, the game sometimes doesnt even load and just over heats my phone, so many of the contents in still "Coming soon" yet it has been quite a long time, hope the Devs fix all the bugs and update soon
Love the game, but it seems no one is really working on it anymore, it says the last update was a year ago :(
fun fun fun enjoy this app and smile
There should be a barbershop at towns to customize your characters look because sometimes we can't find a look we want and end up with a character we don't really like. Either way it still makes sense to have a barbershop at towns.
It is stupid you have to pay for every single one not one is free I HATE IT IT IS AWFUL
I would give it five stars if it added a "restore purchase" button. I spent over $20 on special deals, and then the game glitched out and uninstalled itself , I would either like my money,or my items back,
Amazing and simple.
I could call it a zen game as it's hard to get frustrated, the graphics are charming, the audio is top notch and so far the purchases didn't bother me. Looking forward for more character customization and weather effects
It is a great game. Best hiking game I downloaded. But could you pls lower the fare to the ferry? We have so many things to trade like foods because the stamina gets easily lost and the clothes have a limited time to wear. All in all it is great. Hope you can lower the prices of the things in the game
enjoying it so much, thank you for creating such enjoyable app👍😊
i like it but i wish it wasent that expensive to color
This is a relaxing game
I can't even get pass the tutorial. When the NPC says "Hey traveller, look at me. Look around," I can't see her. I watched others play the game to see if I wasn't looking in the right direction, but they did the same thing I was doing.
love it so relaxing
SOS!!! Before I leveled up my house to level seven I had about thirty thousand dollars after I had zero NONE 0!!! What happened? I'm broke! PLEASE fix love this game but I need that money to trade with. Other than that this game is easy 5 stares. And I will change it to five stars if you can help me. Thank you.
Love the game. My screen randomly turns white in this game for some reason.
hard to navigate
great experience with this app i like to color can sit it down if i could give 10 stars i would great job n thanks p
You guys need to really focus on the attention to detail with the graphics as well as attention to detail in general there's alot of small problems for example in the start the #1 on the mission list is cut off, when the "guide" is walking her feet phase I to the grass. I believein you and if you need any future help with development feel free reach out to me.
Loved the game.. the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's not nearly developed as I'd hoped. There needs to be a way to complete all the objectives!!
you don't have to pay and some you don't need diamonds, pretty good color selection but it could be bigger .
Fun and additive
very nice game but when u downloaded it, it won't appear on my device home page and to open the game, every time I'd have to go to play store and then search it up and then open it.
A beautiful and fun game, but after awhile, it gets very tedious. Update your game, or you'll lose more customers. It's been years now. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like any updates will ever come, so playing the game becomes pointless.
Pretty fun, works good so far
at 1st i thought it was boring, but then i thought I'll give it a chance and im glad i did! I've only just downloaded it about 20mins ago now, and i cant get enough of it. i have 2 of your games, this and Godus and i love both of them. keep up the good work guys!!!😊
really amazing game, I've downloaded it every time i switched devices. only wish loading games was quicker, otherwise everything is perfect. oh and personally i think this is the best because you don't need internet to play, but you can. you don't need money to play, but also can.
The game is very beautiful to me. I love how you can trade for items to either craft or trade as well. This also makes me addicted which I love being addicted to such games! If I could put more stars I would.
I like this because it has variety of things
it's the best art game in the whole entire world
it gives me a chance to connect with my art side
SUPRISE!! ANOTHER DEVELOPER RUINING A GOOD APP BY BEING GREEDY! DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANNA SPEND SPEND SPEND!! ALL ABOUT THE ALL MIGHTY DOLLAR!
Really fun and addictive game but I do have a problem I believe to be glitch related.. My back pack keeps saying I'm carrying to much items and slows me down when I don't even have anything in my back pack
I love it.It brings out the artist in me
i love the game its a cute little adventure game and you dont have a time limit for how long you can play for without payments the ads are really well placed so they dont affect gameplay in a negative way and its fun enough that it stops becoming a mobile time waster while your on the train or so on and i becomes a regular game that you play often its controls are smooth and simple and the gameplay mechanics are easy to learn and usefull 10/10
it is so fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i have nothing to complan about it is adventurive and when playing you never want to stop I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How do you earn more dimands
Pros: great music, stunning graphics, intuitive gameplay. Cons: grindy ( I got bored after less than a month), laggy, crashes a lot after a while.
Its so amazing 😍 I love it
The game is good however too much interruptions from the lady (to assist) while playing the game. That's why I stopped playing this game.
I loved it and the opportunity to constantly get more money and not be bored. I ALWAYS felt like their was something else to look forward to. Something else ASTONISHINGLY fun and adventurous such as finding a town and getting a pet. It was always filled with excitement.
it was fun for a while until it starts shutting down on its own and in multiple times when you try to open it. please fix it the game is really good. i havent recieved any updates from this game since i installed it. i also uninstalled it 2 times just to install it back and hope for the best
I would give this game a 5 star rating but i hate these 2 bugs it kicks me off the tree when i am cuting it seting my progress over and the other one is when i make something it gets stuck in the middle of my screen and it only happens iwhen i am making things in my house! and i have to exit the game and then rejoin the game again and again and its sooo annoing please fix that i love this game it is so much fun and it is nothing like the other game i have played but please fix it!
THIS IS AMAZING when theres nothing to do just open this app ITS GOOD!
The game is a vary fun game and I love that there's a treating. I loved my experience of the game.
Meeting outdoor itchy este guilt
love the tools and pictures.
it okay but there are some glitches
Very relaxing and peaceful. Great game when you are stressed or sad and is friendly for kids. Also teaches some struggles people had to go through a long time ago.
This is a fun and time killer app
wonderful coloring book for your phone keeps me busy.
Loved this game... until it randomly reset my progress and I couldn't restore it. I had made it all the way to the settlement, had a huge mansion packed with stuff, was about to buy a boat and cross the river. Didnt play for a while and when I returned, it put me at the beginning.
I absolutely love this game. I've had it for a while and its never been disappointing to play. I lost my first profile when I got a new phone a few months ago, but I'm honestly not upset at all, its given me the opportunity to fall in love with it all over again!!
It crashed every single time. Please update.
💕💕 i love it now now now
Absolutely Beautiful. It's a simple, magnificent game. The soundtrack, the relaxing cutscenes and animation, the camera angles, the concept. It's a truly beautiful and a must for everyone.
This is a very nice game thank you creator for making this game
Amazing I love it 💚🧡❤💙🖤💛💜
Its a great app and you will love the features
it release stress and it is very addictive
it is totally fun to color on this game!
addictive! ive really enjoyed playing this. it's simple game play but the graphics are immersive and I look forward to my next accomplishments.
I actually like this game but it's not compatible with Samsung note 8 and I can barely play it. I will change my rating when they fix this problem. (I think it's probably because of the edge but I don't know if it's like this with other edge phones or not)
glitch makes game unplayable. I get to "Hey, look at me, I got a red umbrella!" and the girl is not there...I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game, and it won't move beyond this. pity.
This is a good coloring game!!!🙂
Doesn't work. Played it for a couple of hrs, loved the simplicity and freedom to stop and think and plan your next move. However, once I exited, it will no longer load.
game hasn't been updated in a year. sucks because I do love the game. lots of glitches and "coming soon" please update this game. Sometimes the game crashes and when I try to restart the game, it just shows a white screen. Very frustrating.
Really fun little game, one of the few mobile games I enjoy. The art style is also beautiful
Well u should make all the pictures free but it's nice I like it
my data lost,this is what happened: i am playing and i gained 300,000...I've been bored so i deleted it... when i install it again my data lost,,,my 300,000 money is gone,,i even go to iCloud and sign in to google play account but the older one is what i go!!!!help me pppplllsssss!!!!!
It iis okayyyyyy
I it is ok
It's a really good pass time i guess
i love this app when ever i am bored i play this game i dont know how many drowning i have made in these 5 days
No customer support. No updates. This game isn't even finished yet. Such a shame because this game has so so so much potential
I love this game but, i was seconds away from reaching eden falls and the game restarted and when i reopened the app it set me back when i was 20 mins into the game. Im sure its not my device because i have 4 gb of ram and im sure thats enough and this has never happend for any other game that i know of.... Please Help
relaxing except when you run out of diamonds
Best coloring app ever!
I love it it is so fun and you can make what you want to color on there yall all need to download this app ☺☺☺☺😅😅😄😄😄😄😄😄
I'm really enjoying the game. Its a little different than I'm used to but i have had no issues learning the control scheme and gameplay mechanics.Ive only just downloaded it yesterday, but so far its delightful!
I like it so far but when i play it it's good but when i go off of it and go back in am at the starting again and when it tell me to move and bla bla than she say i have the red umbrella than i look for her and i don't see her THAN it tell ME to put my hand down so i did it and it's not WORKING FIX THIS MIX
Didnt save properly I was proper high level and got a new phone on the same google account and it started me again!!!
Awesome colors love it!
It's ok, tiny little spaces to though
simple and relaxing
Please make more adventure games. this is the best adventure game. i love it. no bugs.10/10
I really hate it
Coloring.........seriously, just coloring
Great game lots of fun just movement is a bit buggy like not letting me go faster or slower for a while but it fixed when i opened and closed the app
Wow! This game was great for a moment, it is so interactive and child friendly UI. But as it progresses, it teaches you to become a thief, and trade your thievery to other thieves. It also promotes aggressive adverts that annoys your gameplay experience. The heck! Even the graphics are not optimized, so many micro stutters everywhere!
good picture, but i hope you gift many point
Really fun and worthwhile
nice for anxiety and artistically inclined people
Good and simple
need more color options
not enough free pictures
I really love this app
it's a really beautiful game but it wont let me craft items i have the items in my bag but when i try to drag it to the crafting table it just falls into my bag. I have tried everything from stopping the game and going back in and uninstalling and reinstalling but so far it still wont let me craft.
Love this game. I've played it for years (i had to start over though, but it's okay). In my experience, you accumulate horseshoes pretty fast!!! BUT!!!! WHEN ARE YOU GONNA OPEN THE BIRCH TREE YARD. It's been "coming soon" for years!!!!!
It is basically a ripoff version of Recolor
its good but i dont like that all the cool looking stuff cost dimens
Ohhhhhhbhhhhhh......the best coloring book 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 please apdate it 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
This used to be a great game. But now its too glitchy
love it relaxin and refreshing
What a nostalgic game ,very different and unique game it a console level game ,we will remember it when we grow old we will remember the nostalgia of game
Love it, very relaxing.
I love the game, it very easy to get into and basic enough to play for hours. The only down side is since I changed phones I've lost my previous save that I'd actually spent money on.
This app is fun and free
I love the graphics on this game, but that's about all I like. Walking along the trail, collecting stuff, crafting things, selling things, repeat. I'm looking for something more intellectually simulating than that.
Cute game, but it gets a bit boring after a while.
I really enjoy his back that I can change it until I like it the best
Super fun game
need more styles of art
I love this game and have for years but it seriously needs a update i hope it does get one soon. It has a lot of potential
Fun and mind clearing
This app is calming and fun at times , there is a sense of realism and I enjoy that. The trail is a game for people that want to explore an unexplored wilderness. This game is by far a beautiful game , the graphics are wonderful , the game play of fun , and the the controls are easy. Since I am a very nervous person I got this game and every time I play it I begin to calm down. If your looking for something that you can enjoy for a long time get this game. Good luck.
Firstly it takes alot of time to download and is avery boring game. It is a very dull game, I would prefer not to use it.
it has potential and was a great game but the developers has not updated it since Aug 2018!!! It is lagging and I have to close the app every now and then. It has been a great ride but I am uninstalling it now...
Great idea for a game, i love playing it BUT!!! I have gotten to a certain point and it keeps freezing at the most important times, like when writing a letter or trading. When this happens everything in my pack drops out of my bag and i have to hope no one has stolen it. Please fix this.
It's ok but mistakes are hard for them not to happen.
when u want to erase something u can't it just colours in more
Really fun at the start until you get past the snowy mountains were the ferry guy wants to rip you off. It means you need to go back to the start and walk all the way back to get enough money. To be blunt, not worth my time. Please get rid of the hackers who just walk across the river. Pisses me of every time.
Really good game. Got so far in it that I beat it but couldn't move into any of the end homes because... well they were already taken. It highly upset me that I beat it m.h ut couldn't truly BEAT it. Ugh. Please fix.
i really really enjoy it.!!! its better than smoking a cig.!!!! ( For real )
Its magical and im so glad that i got this app
I really enjoyed this game until I arrived at the first town.The game started to glitch really badly so I deleted and reinstalled it,hoping that it will work again.It doesn't even want to start now,unsatisfied.
I liked the game but it's keep on crashing on starting the game after one play, I played once and then when I tried to play again the next day app keeps crashing and I don't know why, How can I play if the app is not working properly, Fix your bugs and update the app,I am using latest version of Android i.e 9 and playing on MI A3
it is not so fine it needs money to unlock tools
super coluring app
I wish there were more ways to get favors than just to buy them but I do enjoy this game very much
I love to color and it helps with anxiety and and when im nervous
Nic this app is dope
Need a better way too save
Used to be a great game, still is, but there have been some bugs that ruin the whole thing. -the game suddenly stops working -can't always run it without internet -newly crafted items stay in the middle of the screen -no rewards after watching ads
I love it. But it seems as I'm losing some of the ones I've already done. I'm almost sure I am. Is there only a certain amount you can have at the same time?
How to use other pen colors and how to get diamonds without buying
Excellent game with perfect exploration throughout the trail and just a great game overall
good coloring game :)
WAY too many notifications. For someone who played as casually as I did, it was easier to uninstall the game than to disable notifications. I hope the developers realize this.
I was super excited then after the tutorial it freezes I tried it on my tablet and on my phone and it's the same story for both so I don't know
it good i think stuff dont need to cost tho
it is great for you if you need to be relaxed.
It is so fun to shade and coler
Very addictive especially if you enjoy coloring
It's fun, until you faint and people steal your stuff. Uninstalled.
Lost almost all progress even though I kept getting a message that the game was saved. It reloaded from almost the beginning
The Trail is a fun, easy, simulation game that has interesting features and graphics; as well as an interesting story. The mechanics are simple and intuitive, and the traditional design is welcoming in the mobile game market.
This game sounds good, but it combines bad controls with unresponsive collecting mechanics and repetitive gameplay. Even the graphics aren't that appealing, there are no details and because of that the game looks more or less the same. Also it is quite expensive if you want to speed up the grind in my opinion.
Best coloring app I've found so far
Nice and relaxing
Good app but very touchy
The game is no longer cared for and seems to be permanently unfinished, which is incredibly sad because it is very fun to play.
I really like it, me and my little brother are coloring
great for the kids but you have to get diamonds if you want to get coloring
This game is lovely, the graphics are great, but a few things, the camera could be a bit less sensitive and also the touch screen controls are a bit difficult to use, making the character stand up, walk forward and stop is hard to control.
Was super fun but now it's just a white screen :((
It's a good game idk 😑😑😑😑😑😑
It's good.
I try to reinstall but all my item that I purchase all gone. Sigh
Ok so good game but after a while it get really repetitive and boring grinding to build your house but The trail to get there is fun if you watch ads and spend money to get good gear other than that the trail to the house is pretty annoying always having gear break 4/10
You have to pay for every picture
Its Very fun and I am impressed
After one day of using the app I love it!😊👍
not enough colors
The game was good up until when it did a random download and it stopped working. It wouldn't use let me use my last saved game and it was irritating. It kept saying that my account was already being used and I only have this game on my phone. I may have to uninstall it and then re-download it but I don't know. Can I get some help with that please?
I love to color and it's great
Simple but endearing storyline... I play it at night to keep my anxiety down without keeping myself from falling asleep
fun to draw your own design
it's a great game fun to play but I hate how when you pass out other people take your stuff it's unfair and quite annoying I hope you can find a way to change that as it sets people back a lot other than that it's not a bad game just wish people wasn't thief's
They only give you ads when you ask for them, the only thing I hate is the controls, having to swipe going forward and sometimes it doesnt detect your touch. I also hate how the stamina runs out so fast to where I died in front of a camp once.
It is fun at the beginning, but it gets boring after some time. I was super disappointed when I arrived at Eden Falls, the game hypes you to arrive there but once you do all you can do is buy a little shack (that you cannot enter) and move on to another city.
This is a really fun game. Liking the game play but their are some glitches. Sometimes the game freezes and crashes out. Other times you can't get your player to start walking. Otherwise its a pretty fun game.
amazing app l can use it all day
great app lots of fun
super and better performence to othet apps..i like this app
Unplayable due to items not always collecting when I swipe. I also would like to be able to invert the side swipe for viewing.
It's a very nice game with good potential but the thing is there just is't enough freedom. Everything is set for you to go and you do have much big choices, only little ones.
this apps really help me to relise my stres. realy good apps
Very confusing. Have to download this, or download that. Uninstall it right away.
I like the app but I wish I was able to watch videos to earn diamonds
Kind of sucky not gonna lie it's basicaly another coloring app recolor
love the colors!!!!
Its a good game
Game is super addictive! The only problem it doesn't fit phone's screen (Xiaomi Redmi Note 8), that sometimes make the gameplay&controls very uncomfortable. Chopping trees controls need a little bit of improvement, sometime can spend 3 axes to chop 1 tree. Other than that 5/5. Let's see when it's gonna get boring. P. S. Even adds are implemented in the gameplay in a very good way, which does not limit your abilities at all and not ruins the whole impression, but on the contrary adds up to it.
Highly addictive, immersive gameplay. I like the viewpoint of the game, it keeps you interested and gives you a reason to continue playing. *However, in the last week whenever I try to play offline the app shuts itself down whenever opened.
When we reach the destination control hangs and we cannot stay in the town also we have to go back and roam bring materials again. Please add something like quick travel or something.
👍👍👍👍👍 Keep it up
Very good for helping one relax.. Very therapeutic.😍😃
Beautiful game! Lovely, relaxing just amazing! And then you progress.. bugs are everywhere and support never responds. Two things that make me wanna punch someone in the face, with a brick.
Love to just color
Super fun coloring app!
Great for stress and it's awesome😊
This is the most stupidest game of all time you have to pay to color a picture
It's simply an adventure game. You craft better stuff to help you through the game. The environment is beautiful. It's not too complicated, yet not too easy (it's not that popular idle game where you won't feel like playing game). I love it!
Not screen compatible with the Note 9. A lot of parts get off screen making it unclickable and certain pictures overlap at certain times and places that make the item behind it inaccessible. Hopefully will be compatible in later updates.
I like this adventure game because its life in the great outdoors for people who may not live neer the woods. The only problem I found is when ever I try to open up a crafting recipe it crashed the game.
this is so freaking good! i love it ♥
no Just don't get it the colors are just no
This game doesn't even work on my tablet or my phone I just get a blank screen
I love it you can get it if you want
I really like this app. It is Amazing
Great app with cool ART style
relaxing and time comsuming
Completely unplayable, started out ok except I would get this, "google play services has stopped working" and now it won't stop, it pops up every few seconds and I couldn't make it stop, uninstalled this game and it seems to have stopped. Tried this game years ago, gave it 2 star for serious glitches and running issues, now it's just unplayable cause of this pop up every few seconds that also pops up even if the app isn't open. I thought you were cool Kongergate.
pls fix a bug about the tutorial because when the girl with the red umbrella said to look around shes no where in sight. also theres this swipe down tutorial but when i swipe down nothing is happening. i was so looking forward to this game until that happened. i restarted the game plenty of times nothing worked. please fix immediately.
Not a good app Don't download you just pay money your stupid brushs
Can not touch thin lines
Fun concept got immersed into it for hours, but it just becomes grind, especially once you reach the first settlement, and realize much to your annoyance, that you have to go through all those hours of grind again. It's like punch in the gut rather than a reward for putting in all that time and effort.
This app is Simply Awesome! :)
It's a good game
I love this app. I defently recomend it.
Has alot of bugs ads glitching repetedly popping up in one place stopping you 30 times in one spot. Graphical glitches mamy places.
It has had pictures and cartoon pictures
One of the best coloring app
Just great the game for me. Some won't like it thats ok and the journey is the best part.
its very slow at loading
I rated this game back in 24 January 2019 four stars and I spend a lot of money in this game I really regret that😠.This game can actually be amazing if they cared a little bit it was unique and good
The images are awesome
This makes me so relax, I love this app so much.
its fun you can earn diamonds and buy things
Well it's not the best game ever but it does help with my anxiety all in al l not bad
awsome appp seriously good color options
awsome game! i just dont like how you have to wait for dimonds
After a long walk i finally walk into town.. except I've somehow managed to create my own town when i wanted to buy a plot. Can't find the option to move out and delete my town, and losing interest over a game that forces me to play alone.
This game is so fun i hope i get sponsider.
Can you add more portraits?
I love this app
I like this app because it helps me to think.
Loving it so much so far
it's amazing to know your coloring ability..
All I like about it is that I love coloring
relaxing & fun.
Good app for passing time.
New Perspective and Warning! The town I'm in is actually flourishing and we have all been looking forward to updates to continue doing so but things have changed. Now I still find it worth 5 stars and funding despite recent discoveries: Due to no response from support about money issues I had and searching through forums for help, I discovered there is a huge chance that, unannounced, the game has been abandoned by its developers. I am currently waiting for a response by Kongregate now.
Very fun to play and awesome concept but the constant crashing at the worst moments makes it almost unplayable. I ran out of stamina and the game crashed causing me to lose half of my stuff including tools...
I love it! It's the best out there...as of yet anyways!
It's a great game but it crashes a LOT. The developers desperately NEED to do something about it. Items move on there own and fall out, you suddenly can grab stuff, stuff fall out of your backpack in camps resorting to ppl stealing them. AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF I literally lost almost 20 minutes progress even though I closed the game while I was at a camp. And also it gets super slow out of nowhere. I want to continue playing because it's legit a good game but it has...a lot if problems
Great game but I am having trouble getting past the loading screen (same day I installed) managed to get a little bit through the game but now upset that I cannot play. Can you possibly make an update for better loading? Many thanks.
Fun but needs bug fixes. Items dissapear from my house and pack overnight. Very difficult to pull raccoon tails. My game will not stay connected to Google play so no cloud back up. I'm concerned that the devs have not updated this game in over a year!
So interesting and lovely 💖💖💖💖
Fun game and definitely more than I expected. Give it a try before you decide it's not worth your time!
great idea to have diamonds for pics and colors I love it
awesome best game to play when you are boared
This app said coloring AND drawing. >:(
Fun Games = CREATETIVE GAMES
This game is great and i love playing it, the only problem is when you finsh going on the trail you have to go back on the trail and you have to grind for a really long time to get anything in the town unless you make a in game pursuse.
I love this app it is amazing because I love art
Good game in general. I'm just not happy with having to wait for long periods of time because the game is downloading stuff. Recently, when I finally got in, a good part of my progress was gone. IDK what I need to do to fix this. Thanks.
Beautiful App for colouring ...
Very peacful nature nice music game is very good soon your team kongregate would get update of "The trial". Thank you.....Nice players crafting selling are nice you developed a nice game.👍
I keep encountering a glitch when I craft something it just freezes in the middle of the screen.
Cool,it has good templates
It's nice and relaxing
Its the best app
I really enjoyed playing The Trail. There is just so much creativity and fun to be had!
really good for art lovers
So far so good
An awful game. Crude graphics, clumsy character control (I never did figure out how to turn my character around), relentless pitches for expensive boosts and upgrades without which your progress is agonizingly slow, seemingly pointless descriptions of the next stop on the trail, plus if I wanted to kill things there are plenty of other games for that.
So funnnnnnn very!
I rate this as you also have to bye staff for dimonds
Its so calming if you would like to relax
Always been a fun game, great little updates make it even more smooth. Love the art style too.
I think it fun and keep people feel happy
So i played this on my iphone a while back and loved it. I since abondoned iphone and cant get my ild game back. So decided to try this again with a new account. It was awesome at firat, but thw last couple of weeks the games been really buggy. Also just now i decided i wanted to change towns. Beware! I got the white screen of death after doing this and now the game doesnt start. I just get white screened.
Fun game.. well I think it would be.. freezes up constantly. So many bugs. 🤷‍♂️
Highly addictive & relaxing
PLAYER BEWARE: This is a dead app. No updates. No response from support. Game still seems to run ok but there are glitches. Make sure to force stop your game every 30 mins or you will lose progress and items when it glitches.
The best coloring app I've yet to find!
It's awesome tottsly worth it no problems at all no adds its just great and completely frww
Very nice and fun game. Doesn't annoy you with ads and it is not pushing you to buy all the time.
I played the game once a while back and loved it. I tried to re-download it today and it won't do anything but show a white screen. I was really looking forward to playing again, but can't
i love this game so much i love the letters and everything. what i dont like is that even though im rested and i have 2 green hearts, as soon as i begin to wall they turn red and i pass out easily, i dont know why. all of my "gear" is in good condition
Fake multiplayer (basically ai trained to pick up your stuff when you faint and don't pay the premium currency). Boring after 15 minutes but it keeps you playing because you want to know what eden fall looks like. You need to pay money to colonize in the "eden fall".
The BEST coloring app by far!!!! 💗💗💗💗💗
Really fun! I wish there were more things to do. I had trouble finding the things I needed, and got stuck frequently. But all the same, a very fun game. It would be helpful if you could get to town without walking for ages
Awesome game. At first I was a bit skeptical about how much I would enjoy it, but two hours later, and I am still playing. I love the atmosphere and the crafting component has a minecraft vibe without being yet another minecraft game
really relaxing and amazing pictures
realy nice realy cute and cute drawings
Not my cup of tea
it's good. but not addictive and fascinating!!
It's nice but you need to spend 10 dimons each Tim you want something
I LOVE THE GAME
Have to pay money to do much on this app.
Relaxing and fun!
Fun way to pass the time
great game actually, and finally, i arrived at Town 😆 but, it still laggy on my 2gb ram phone even on the lowest graphic.. the clothes are also ruined too quickly.. we need to manage very crazily to store items on our very limited bag..
Great coloring app
This has to be my favourite game I recommend this 💯% I enjoy this game but the only thing is when there is a lot of people at the camp it goes really slow and glitchy so if that's possible could you fix it please! But other than that I LOVED IT
Hey I love the place and also the graphics but what I experience is bug🙁and lack of sensitivity in the game I'm trying to move the moves are so laggy please fix this issue and also why there is going back option please you really need to fix because I missed some logs in the woods and I'm trying my way back the controls says that's not possibile please fix this issue thanks for creating such a wonderful game... 😍😗🤗🤗
It is full with bugs.I do not get my chits ,and i cant get out from the purchase screen of Teng Fei to continue my games in the tutorial . Now great , i cant even get into the games .Sincerely hoping that the bug can be fixed .
It keeps canceling mu work
It's relaxing and fun
I love it and also if you have to sign in why don't we don't
The colors are great.
This is a great game but it crashes a lot. Pity that when it crashes, you lose stuff. Beginning to get annoying.
This game will crash as soon as it starts to get good. I have played on and off WiFi. I have uninstalled and installed again. I have changed the graphic settings. I have a brand new phone and this should not happen. Its clear the game has been abandoned by devs
it is a beautiful game. however, after playing this for such a long time, i deleted it because it got repetitive and especially to the point where you have to keep remaking items - who has the time (even though you're wasting time playing games) 🤷🤦
I love this app! totally recommend 👍👍👍👍
Nice but buggy
having issues with game. When I craft something it just sits in the middle of my screen. Not sure what's going on. Have to restart game for stuff to fall into bag..
I loved this game when it first came out, and I'm so glad I picked it up again after SO long. I've found that I love it still. I absolutely recommend this game - it's very well made and beautifully designed. The ambient music is perfect and just... I love everything about this game.
Its really glitchy
Woow awesome drawing game.
awesome tho its slow getting diamonds and you have to be online
Very good app
love this very relaxing
Love this game! Only issue are a few glitches with the background every now and then, but I'm having a blast!
fun to use and a great time killer
I really love this game and the only reason I have it rated so low is in the hope of getting attention. there are a lot of places labeled "coming soon" or "opening soon" and the game hasn't been updated in almost a year. I just really like to see new features and more things opened. I still love the game and find it very entertaining and simple and will continue to play until I have no more tasks to complete.
I loved this game!!! But the game keeps crashing and I have to close it. The graphics are slow so the game skips so items are missed. Can you please fix the stability issues within the game??
This app has great tools for art ❤
Initially very promising, but reveals repetitively bland gameplay which resulted to my permanent disatisfaction. Rewards are nothing when gameplay is circular. Storyline seems to be minimal. Character customization is limited as your character's features stay as they are from that avatar randomization at the start. You're also forced to equip clothes as they are purely functional items; no fun whatsoever.
surprisingly fun, decently basic game but so far I'm very impressed for a free game. micro transactions available but definitely still lots of fun without them. graphics are impressive for the type of game. controls are a little unresponsive at times but very intuitive. overall a+ what a calming, fantastic game :)
Definitely a unique game. I have yet to find one like it, the way everything is done and made. I have been playing this game for quite some time, almost non-stop. Sometimes it can be a bit laggy, but a simple close/reload can fix the problem. other than that, it's an excellent game.
I think it is really fun one thing I don't like is u kinda have to pay 😟
awsome exept you have to by colors every time you exit
Its fun but you have to pay for alot
I dont know what people are complaining about. You cant pick up stuffs?? Then stop walking and you can. It's a no branier. Trying to overtake NPC's doesnt get you additional advantage. Just play at your own pace. No updates thats my only concern. I've already travelled the most.
Its really cool I really like this app
I is very fun.
Great game but when I am nearly reaching Eden falls the game begins to lag.Please fix this issue
it seemed like a very good game. my only issue is that my phone is cracked, and the screen is black exactly where the heart is. so i'm only deleting it because of that issue. good game otherwise!
Best for release stress!
I played this game and got a new phone. Only then I find out that you permanently lose your account as soon as u try and login onto another device. No point playing if you'll just lose all your data.
Love it keep up the good work
Awesome game I really recommend it. The game is smooth and polished, the controls are easy to learn, and the game is really fun to play.
i use to have this app and then i delete it for some reason, but now *my previous work is gone*, eventhough the drawing is free
I don't like that you need points to unlock some colors, and pics
When i bought a hide bag from the floating house, and then my game froze so i restarted it. When i came back , my bag was gone and the horse coins thingy also decreased to 3. Please fix this , this game is overall very fun ☺☺
I had passed many islands then i deleted the game, when i installed it and tried to log in to have my saved journey , i found myself starting again but the achivements of google play was done, i want my saved game....
Cous you have to pay 💰💰💰
It is good a little more complicated than I'm used to
Fun and challenging
It is getting annoying that we have to swipe up to pick something up and that's how you change your Sprint meter to if you want a walk or Sprint
I'm in love with this game! Everything about is just crazy good! I'm very grateful for the creators of this game, honestly.
Best coloring app
sucks cant get any free color pages
It is a fun game with beautiful graphic. Lately there has been major lag/freezing issues as well as crafted items disappearing. Very frustrating spending time collecting items to craft just for the game to freeze and loose valuable items.
Not even realistic u ned damonz i do not like it😡😡
I actually love this game. It's fun and very interesting. But it crashes a lot...several times a day creating frustration of having to start over and or loosing things. Please fix it!!!
Its easy and fun at the start but it gets really challenging.
Exciting ,Calming Relaxing
great especially with three Stylo4
Love the app and highly recommend
I love how you can choose your own colors
A bit glitchy but otherwise good and I love the art style!
it amasineg itr srro preatyits culinging really preeatylove the coloring the colors are so preatyi have never sean colors bleined that i just wishall the all colors look way that mixingcolors like the thatpicutre thelikealot
The diamond thing shouldn't be in the app, but I like the app
It's fun and time consuming
The game itself is great, amazing art work, it's obvious they put alot of time and work into the game. My only complaint would be the crafting system, I can make or "craft" things at any given point. It doesnt make sense that you cant in the game.
I love that you can choose the colours
Reminds me of the Oregon trail that I used to play in school. I wish there were more events and updates. I spent money on it when I first started but now I have saved enough that I don't have to spend any real money. I wish it stated how many stops until the next environment without checking it on the web.
What others have said, the devs abandoned the game and haven't updated it in over a year. There are still many bugs. After crafting items, some will randomly freeze in the middle of the screen. The game itself is great. The graphics are great. But this company doesnt deserve your time or money.
I think the game is good but the old school graphics and the talk in between makes things worse and slow. The pace of the game is very very slow install only if u have a lot of time to spare. It doesnt deserve more than 3*s believe
The new update lags a lot . The game stops and goes to the home screen
is what it says on the tin always new pics as well.
I love this game! I wouldn't mind seeing some kind of fishing minigame, and the option to name your dog!
it is so relaxing too play.
Sometimes, es gay
Enjoyable game for people who like to explore the world of nature. The graphics and animation are smooth, memory consumption is good, no ads., user guide is good, settings arrangement good, user interface is good, sounds and music are good. Fun relaxing game. Thank you
I hate it doesn't have a lot of colors
i love ilove i love this its so fun you can do all sorts of thing.😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜
Love this app
It's a fun slow paced game only problem is high level players backtrack and can take all the good items and dominate at trade
this was a cute game i picked up off and on since its release, considering the dev has since moved on with his life and is preparing to release/abandon his next ambitious and groundbreaking fizzle
FREEZE FREEZE FREEZE This app was super fun and I was loving it, but now it crashes every 5-10minutes and I lose my progress. its free so I let it go for the first few times, but it kept getting worse and worse. Now it's barely playable.
Not nearly enough free stuff.
PLEASE COME BACK AND FIX THIS GAME! PLEASE REMEMBER THAT YOU GUYS HAVE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THIS GAME! THERE'S STILL SO MANY PEOPLE WHO PLAY THIS AND BUY STUFF PLS COME BACK AND MAKE THIS GAME WHAT IT WAS. I CAN'T EVEN SELL OR USE WAREHOUSE WITHOUT FREEZING THEN I LOSE ALL MY PROGRESS OR WHAT I SOLD AND DID THEN IT TAKES ME 20 MIN TO GET BACK INTO THE GAME .. PLS FIX THIS GAME! IT'S NOT FAIR TO ABANDON IT YET STILL TAKE MONEY FROM US. I LOVE THIS GAME PLS FIX IT!
It's so fun I love it ❤️♥️💕❤️😘😘😊😘😊😘
Not exciting. Interesting idea but it gets lost in dull gameplay (75% of the game is just walking on a virtual path), and from what I hear reaching the town isn't satisfying enough to be worth it.
Great app. love the options
this game was the best but how many times do i have to buy the brush???
Low quality of your drawings
This game is absolutely awesome, the way you're just exploring a new world in history and for you as a player and despite of the "long" walks you have to do between each campsite they never become bored. I highly recommend it, love it
this game is fun but not really good sorry but this is a NO!!!! for me
i absolutely loved this game the way its designed is amazing. definitely loved the trail and hope to see more games like this in the future keep up the good work and hope to see more updates such as fishing because that would open soo much more missions ect but keep up the good work
Keeps crashing, which is a shame because its a fun game otherwise
I love the game. Spend a good amount of hours playing it... But I don't know what kind of gift from the aliens phone you need to have for this game to run even at 30 fps constantly. And also what's going with the land purchasing part? I had the funds and I couldn't buy it. That was the point where I got too frustrated with the game and uninstalled it
It's fun to create pitchers
i absolutely love this game, great upgrades for the house, easy to get no time limit clothing items. relaxed. however as mentioned... i always get the white screen and can't get in the game as well as the crafting bugs. please fix!
Everything is fantastic, I love it. But I got to the falls (or the camp before) and now everything is broken. I fall through the world, I can't open tabs, can't trade, can't move. Please help me with this, I love this game
Great game, best I ever played from App Store, but the big drawback is that I've never seen an update! Update! I want an update! I maxed everything I could.
The game ok but what i dont like is it lags to much and kicks me off the game every time i walk almost every time in between camps slows my progress right down cause i have to restart the game and start back from the camp i was before i started walking
Needs a in-game support for bugs. Swiping is easy but makes it harder when you do it for everything ie mean to swipe for one action but it thinks you're doing another. Having trouble with signing into Google Play, but Kong works fine. Absolutely love the game overall!
it's great but I can't do the right spot
I love this game, it's so cute and fun. Simple, yet so addicting, it can be challenging at times, but it's all worth it. Thank you for the wonderful game ❤
Superb I love coloring so I loved this app
I like this app but 2 problems 1.i wish you didnt faint 2.at least dont make people able to steal from you Please remove that makes it harder
Im addicted to the game, I've been playing for ours on end. The ads are implemented so cleverly that I love the ads. My only disappointment is the co-op multiplayer, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be that way but it feels like I'm playing with AI all the time.
the app is very fun and relaxing
so cool, easy to draw
this game is awesome !!!!it relax me when I'm stress!I gave 5 🌟!
love it, is very addictive.
it's a fun game but it goes a little fast they need to explain it more and have materials closers that have too far away and you can't find it they should at least make sure your stamina and everything else is up if you have to run or something like that and they should at least have you had the option of having a partner is going to be an animal or somebody else to make the trip more fun
Characters are ugly as hell. Can't really do much with shells after the first quest so I don't even know why they appear all the time. Inventory space is so small and it seems like wooden carvings are only good for selling I was expecting to be able to trade with someone for like 5 wooden carvings in the next few camps but nothing.
Fun if you have nothing else to do
The google play progress was lost. It reloaded to an earlier point but then said their was no Google account found.
its really good and creative.
Honestly great game. Wasn't expecting much with it being free. The graphics are great. Actual gameplay is really calming yet addicting. The controls can be a bit finicky but all in all it's a fantastic game
Great game..and I was hooked immediately. But I encountered the "Google play stopped working " bug which is annoying af. Came to the reviews to see if anyone else in the community had suffered my fate and instead came to the conclusion that this game is indeed...abandoned by the Devs..Unfortunatel as I was 1km ish from the first town. No dev reviews on any commentary positive or negative dating back to the middle of the year. :(
love it, got my step mom and daughter hooked on it.
i really like the game play but once i closed the app i could not get it to open again!!! it does lag a little because of graphics and the controls take a bit of getting used to but i just wish it ran better!
great easy to use
Game is glitchy
art is so fun
This one of the best player
Its a really good coloring app
Best adventure game EVER! the graphics in general are great and I love the lil dogos so fluffy and cute! and it's really time consuming its great when I wait for my mom to pick me up from school and some of the kids at my school play it to!
fix some buuuuuuugs!!!!!!!!!!!!! whenever i try to turn my screen to grab items it forces me to look strait. it is so annoying please fix this bug and others! also it requires to much info on me and now I deleted it for good
I just want some awesome coloring things to do and now I get on here and find out I have to jump through hoops so I'm uninstalling very disappointed
I love the app so bad it I cool and I have fun I can relax more it makes me so relax
I like you can create your own colored pic
I love to travel and I love to colour it make the work easy
Re installed the game got back to camp 57 but i was supposed to be at 85 . and i was located in my old town but the buildings were that of my new town. please fix the glitch.
i love to color so this is perfect
I'm a little disappointed with the pitch of the !music and voice its so high its like earrape and I can't even understand what they are saying and u should be able to make your avatar not go swiping through faces at the beginning
Good game overall, can be replacement for people who don't go out much
I keep getting white screen whenever opening the game. Still, its really fun though.
I like this game it is so fun
I love this game
I love the app i highly recommend you check out this app it is the best game in the world
I am extremely picky with games. This game, however, is something else. The concept of it is very addicting and before I knew it I spent hours straight on this game. Only frustrating part is how quickly the durability of items deplete. Overall it is worth the time.
really enjoy it, would recommend it!
it is super cool fun and easy
It's addicting also very stress relieving
Having been a fan of Organ Trail, i am excited to finally find a game that gives you that sense of feel that your life can expire as nature dictates, or truly master your surroundings and survive. Those of us that are so like minded will flurish, those that fail ill see you on the side of the road as i pass i promice to wave before you expire completely ah ha ha ha... Very good game, well done
It kept freezing up
Welp thats nice! I dont play for awhile and I got to restart over. Paid for a couple things (mostly that were on sale) and I was pretty far along. That sucks! I guess it doesnt save anything when you unistall and dont reinstall for a couple of years!😒 Smh
Love all the colors
very addictive! love it.
this game seems like an amazing thing from the reviews and the pictures but..it won't let me download it. this might be my phone but this has not happened with any other app so I'm going to assume it is yal'l. I have an old Samsung galaxy, and I hope you can fix this problem so I can play this in the future
The app is great
Its actually not bad for a game 👍👍👍👍
I like the game. But it's very glitchy and has a lot of bugs. You can't play it. It doesn't even open now.
its a great app i spend hours on it a day
I like it, its easy and fun
I like it but is borings and too many adds
Very good and relaxing
I am not a fan of this game because it costs money and my parents said no whenever I wanted to buy something 😡🤧
Fun and entertaining
You dont need to waste your time on this game due to the lack of update and new features unlike other not notable games keeps updating their games to achieve its greatness.Im gonna admit it was a fun game but with the lack of updates and new features,I will try not to play this game untill a new feature comes outta nowhere and i will comeback to enjoy its gameplay.
u can color or draw
I used to play, but I uninstalled and now im trying ro play again because my gf is. anyway it loads up the passport screen and tells me it detects a save and azks if I want to migrate it. I go through with the migration but it just stays at the passport screen. I dont want to start again, why wont it load my old file?
Really good rpg game and explains the directions nicely
So cool! Helps with stress
You get to be creative when you coler
I love this app
very calming and colorfull.
So Far , So Good , Still Exploring It
Love this app❤️❤️❤️❤️
It's amazing and soooo stess relieving!
Fun to color..
Best coloring app ever!
Think it would be a pretty fun, cute, little game, sadly i have to reinstall it if i choose it or accidentally look at an advert as it crashes and will never lose again. Might be worth looking into.
The game is a poly-somewhat adventure where you travel 10's of kilometers on foot and you can craft things like shoes to food to weapons for hunting. This game is a great game if U want to let time fly or you want a game that might challenge you, and etc. I really urge you to try this game once in ur whole lifetime, ur going to enjoy it.
like this game so much very relaxing
it's not better than Recolor App.
Boring game. Keeps glitching and making me lose items I've collected and shows WAY too many ads. This game pretty much just exists to get you to dowload other games. Worst game I've played. Don't waste your time.
its a great app in the world
it's great fun its soothing
Really peaceful and relaxing
Pretty good not gonna lie
New designs r on fire loving it...add some more designs
I love it. There are so many quests you can do and items you can get. Its the best games ever
It has every thing you could think of in coloring
Good for coloring app
fanatic app. brilliant to blend
Love it nice and calming!
Fun game worth a play till town then stop. No active community and no updates have lead to a sadly dead game.
It is a lovely game but as I progress it becomes more and more impossible to play. I have sent an email and hope to get a response soon. I don't want to uninstall but will be forced to soon if something is not done.
My kid loves it
I've enjoyed the game and the way you play it was quite interesting. I love how the way I can quicken the pace. But I encountered a bug. All of the items I produce just get stucked in the screen. Even the winnings for trading are there. 😢
Unique game for a change, and I've tried A LOT of what play store has to offer. Gives me a nostalgic feeling like when I played Wind Waker. Love the artwork and character voices the best. Good job developers!
Awesome I LOVE IT so relaxing
Like it so far😉
I love this game,its highly adictive. But due to the issues im not able to play. When im making a trip it freezes the game and i have to restart at the previous camp fire. I cant progress in the game cause of it so ill never reach the goals. Hooe it gets fixed soon so i can olay it again.
one of my favorite coloring apps by far!
I love it is good for people who like to color and is good in you spare time
Nice, great colors!
Super laggy. I would rate this as the laggiest game in history!
It's enjoyable and my kids love it too.
Love this app
This is my 3rd time re-downloading this game, it's easy, relaxed (other than when other players steal my stuffs lol) and addictive.
it's very nice and I like the different kinds of color
fun and easy
Petty good game but there are better games on the store. Very addictive but after a very very long time it kinda gets boring. Stamina goes down way too fast.
the tools are good and this game superb wwoooooooowwww
Great adventure game, the only issue I have is that the pet shop never seems to reset which dog breeds are in there so your stuck with three dogs that you may not want to buy. Could you guys add in a pet shop reset option so that the dog types in the shop change every once in a while?
This game is absolutely beautiful. It has great gameplay with the town, the trail, challenges, and basically every aspect! This is a game I would and have recommended to a bunch of friends, It's all around a great experience that you'll definitely love playing!
I mean, it's fun at first (when it's working) but the controls are horrible. The lag is horrible, and it gets boring quick. I like the style and the idea.
Its a great app keep going with the great work!
Bought new phone, had to start again. After a couple of days, my level 14 house finally popped up, but was missing over 20 large chest full of items, all furniture gone, town gold is gone, crafting is reset but I got my 300 horseshoes. I had over 1m chits, that's gone, my progress on the map is gone. How come only bits of my progress are showing up? Incredibly frustrating when I've spent so much time collecting and building everything. I would give 5 stars if my items & crafts could be returned
App sucks because its easy to loose your whole progress and you will get no support from the creators. It is quite irritating. If you could give the game a rating of zero stars, that would be my rating.
the ladie in the beginning with the red umbrella isn't even there. can't even start the game
It's a lovely app
Good time passer
Love this app great time killer!!👍❤❤
Game looks fun, but I'll never know if it is because it keeps freezing on the intro screen every single time. I've uninstalled and reinstalled five times now and it always freezes at the exact same place no matter what I do.
it was really easy and fun.
This game is interesting. Too bad it frustrates me when I'm trying to feed my person and they don't take, then I lose my Stamina and collected items. The controls in general need to be better.
all of a sudden the game snapped. I had just reached the place where you buy a home. The carving station jammed. when i restarted the game all i can see is white screen. edit: i just reinstalled the game and all my progress is gone. UNINSTALLED
It'svery relaxing and calming
Awesome so relaxing....after all that aggression and strain of battle royale....this is so cool
kewl to purchasy & then some thing are only for that pic recolor is better 🐼
I really loved this app so much.
good but its to sensative to the touch
Fab injoyable game
good pictures and color's
like picking my own colors wish i could get more diamonds by mini games or watching adds or simething
I really want to give 5 stars but the crashes are constant. Can hardly play 10 min without it freezing or shutting down. Looks like a lo g time problem the developers don't care to fix. Really a shame it's a unique game.
need more free drawings
A very nice idea, however, i am having sound issues. The voices and music are distorted and full of crackles and just sound like a garbled mess which i can barely understand. please fix this.
I really enjoy the dynamics and player interaction in this game, but part of me wishes there were day/night cycles and different items can be found during day and night, for example: there could be more racoon appearances at night, the addition of predators like wildcats and coyotes would also be interesting, but anyway i absolutely ADORE this game, keep up the good work :D
love this app! so many cool things
fun and relaxing
I downloaded the game and at first had lots of fun traveling the trail, I had a few problems where I would purchase a piece of gear from the balloon trader or get it for free from a video and it would immediately drop on the ground and be picked up by other players. The other problem I had with the game is as soon as I reached Eden Falls the game slowed down ridiculously. Other than that the game is O.K.
This game is such a fun game for people like me who love adventuring and exploring an open world. One of the best features about this game is it is relaxing and I enjoy playing before bed. Lastly this game is one of a kind and I think there should be more like this. P.S theres hardly any ads
Unique but the flaws are super frustrating. I got a new item from someone but it "auto" put in my pack but that was full. It just slid out and disappeared. Ugh. No trading or making before I get items? If I win at trading I'm given an item I have to carry to the next camp... I.e. taking up room in the pack! Still playing though. Better than candy crush and picross
I like the game it just the it would freeze
It so cool love it you can do this all day
Nice app. Well made.
somewhat color limited
It's such a cool app... Do try it...
The devs abandoned this game long ago. Don't spend money!! I used to play awhile back, but the ghost towns pushed me away.
The goal you're first presented with is to get to this town, this land of opportunity. I forgot what it's called, cuz this game is so damn forgettable, but here's the thing: maybe it's great once you reach the town. I wouldn't know. I'll never know, because it takes way too long and is way too boring to get there. I could go and play an exciting game for a couple hours instead.
I love it so much
The game's not bad. I just wish there was more ways collecting money. Because when you don't have enough to buy a ticket for the boat, you have to go back to the last camp and collect stuff, so you can sell when you go back to the boat again. Other than that I'm satisfied with the game. :)
HORRIBLE I CAN ZOOM IN BUT CANT SLIDE TO THE OTHER SIDE
I love this app. I would recommend it to anyone
Great game, but abandoned. Played till end of trail. Game is 5 stars, abandonment is 0 stars.
i've been playing this for a long time, but i stopped because of study, now im coming back playing this..its so relaxing and the scenery is just so great! hopefully maybe the dev can improve the graphic? i think it would be cool! keep up the good work 💕
A very nice and relaxing game. It takes some pacing but also planning. paying to bypass the trip to the town doesnt give you too much of an edge as you miss a lot of the game's journey, where the scenery and uniqueness shines.
just started the game so still making up my mind. the graphics and sound are neat. also the fact that you can trade makes up for an interesting addition. so far so good. still trying to figure out how to talk to fellow travellers on the trail.
i really want to enjoy this game but it keeps closing or stopping. Also I am on the mission to get logs with my axe, I had too much stuff in my backpack so my axe fell out onto the ground and someone else picked it up instantly and it wont let me create a new one even though i have all the stuff so im just sol and have to restart
The reason I rate this game one star is because wene I got to spring falls the game started to bep and then it crashed and forced my phone to turn off. .. Edit:it turnes out that the Devs have 100% abandoned the game and I think that they might have created FAKE accounts to make it seem like there game is better than it actually is
I had to restart the game from the beginning because I chose the tanner house but there was a bug and I had a blacksmith house instead. I paid for things in this game and I want a refund. Also, I try to contact the developpers to resolve this issue but they're not responding.
I love the view and the graphics, but the grind to get the money to cross lakes is just way too much, i went back a couple of times, collecting everything i can, and i still can't afford the ticket. I also don't understand the community setting. I went far into the game, it didnt do me any good and its actually more than a hassle.
amazing very enjoyable too color
I love this app it let's u draw on the drawings
Loving the variety of pictures it has to offer
The concept and the game itself is great. I have no complaints other than the warehouse and how unclimactic my arrival at the falls is. The warehouse definitely has a bug or a glitch or whatever you call it. I cant seem to put items on the crates without it loading.
Technically, it lag a lot even on the lowest graphic setting. And I think this game should be updated more often, work need to be done for the objectives. It's been 2 year and we are still stuck on the same objective.
Really great game, the checklist and making it to eden is really what keeps me going. Must have great patience for this game but it is enjoyable.
this is so cool because I can make a drawing then color it #so cool
If there is no wifi u cant color it thats y i gave it a 4 😀😀😀😀😀😀😆😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀yea 500😀😆
This game is great. I love being able to find and craft things. Moving up the trail you see many different things and encounter different resources. My only complaint is sometimes it lags and crashes.
Overall, fantastic and enjoyable concept. Beautiful art and entertaining characters. However, the game controls are lacking and the game sadly lags quite a bit, despite graphic setting at low. Would give five stars if touch points and controls were better executed.
I love the concept of the game and something about it is quite therapeutic! However, there are bugs in the game that hinders the experience and I wish there were more frequent updates.
I love this app and I am happy I installed this app.
I love love love this game. It's very relaxing if not funny. I love the community I live in and everything. The only problem? A small glitch when crafting where the item gets stuck in the crafted box. A quick restart and you are good to go.
I think that it's great wish there were more pictures though
I love this app
This game is just so relaxing to play! It's the perfect solution for people like me who love exploring but get really tired of having to fight monsters or watch your back every second. Must play!
I love the app 😘
